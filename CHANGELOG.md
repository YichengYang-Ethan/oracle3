# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- The MCP server failed to start in fresh installs: `openai-agents` now allows `mcp` 2.x, where `FastMCP` was renamed `MCPServer`. The server supports both SDK versions and a CI job tests against the newest SDK.
- Tool errors (venue failures, out-of-range inputs, unsupported fee schedules) are raised as `ToolError`, so their messages reach the agent under mcp 2.x instead of a generic "Error executing tool".
- `oracle3 --version` printed a hard-coded 1.0.0; it now reports the package version.
- `mcp` (>=1.19,<3) is now a core dependency instead of arriving only through `openai-agents`. The short-lived `mcp` extra is gone; `pip install oracle3` includes the server.
- If a client cached 1.2.0, run `uvx --refresh oracle3 mcp` once to pick up the fix.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **MCP server** (`oracle3 mcp`, `oracle3-mcp`) with 13 tools: market search, market details with resolution rules, order books, quotes with each market's fee schedule, offline and live no-arbitrage checks, fee calculator, Wang-transform fair value, local relation store, and a local paper-trading ledger. No tool can place a real order. Listed in the MCP Registry as `io.github.YichengYang-Ethan/oracle3` via `server.json`.
- **`oracle3.fees`**: Kalshi (effective July 7, 2026) and Polymarket taker and maker fee schedules as published, with per-market schedules read from each venue's API.
- **`oracle3.arbitrage`**: static checks for implication, exclusivity, complement, same-event and event-sum relations, returning the cheapest guaranteed-payoff basket with per-leg fees and the edge before and after fees.
- **Research note** `docs/research/fee-frontier.md` and `scripts/fee_frontier.py`: break-even violations under the published fee schedules.
- `AGENTS.md`, `llms.txt`, `codemeta.json`, a `pm-constraint-arbitrage` agent skill, and a docs page for the MCP server.

### Changed

- Repository renamed to `oracle3-prediction-market-agent`; the PyPI package and import name stay `oracle3`.
- Project description unified across the README, PyPI, GitHub, `CITATION.cff`, `.zenodo.json` and the docs site.
- `oracle3 market list/search/info` read Kalshi's `*_dollars` price fields and Polymarket's search endpoint. Kalshi prices had been returning 0 since the move to dollar fields, and Polymarket search only scanned the top 100 events.
- Agent skills translated to English and checked against the current CLI (`research features`, `research labels`, `research discover-alpha`, `trade get-state` and `trade swap-strategy` no longer exist).
- `run_full_simulation.py` translated to English; its docstring now states which inputs are simulated.
- Strategy comments no longer call the flat 0.005 per-side fee "conservative"; it is below the venues' taker fees at mid prices.
- **Documentation accuracy pass** — corrected claims to match the code exactly:
  - "peer-reviewed pricing model" → the Wang Transform (Wang 2000) calibrated in the author's working paper (Yang 2026, SSRN). The calibration is an unrefereed working paper; only the transform itself is from the peer-reviewed Wang (2000).
  - Strategy count restated as **6 constraint-based + 2 statistical-arbitrage + 2 model-driven** (10 total), replacing the ambiguous "8 constraint-based arbitrage strategies" phrasing in the README, paper, `CITATION.cff`, and `.zenodo.json`.
  - Removed an inaccurate "vectorized NumPy/PyTorch module" description of the pricing engine from the preprint — the deployed path is dependency-light pure Python; NumPy/SciPy are used only by the optional batch MLE estimator.
  - Softened `SpreadExecutor` ("being wired into the multi-leg strategies") and MEV-protection ("best-effort, with public-RPC fallback") descriptions to match their implemented status.
  - Corrected the hierarchical `D` covariate description from "days remaining to expiry" to total contract duration (hours), matching the estimated model.
- Added a verified / not-demonstrated section to the README (paper-traded status, fee economics, roadmap).

### Fixed

- **Removed fabricated profit accounting** from the flash-loan prototype, which previously booked a placeholder `amount * 0.005` profit on a Memo-only transaction.

### Moved

- Relocated the flash-loan arbitrage prototype to `oracle3/experimental/` and labeled the multi-agent pipeline and on-chain reputation modules as non-production prototypes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- **Wang Transform MLE** (`oracle3.pricing.wang_mle`): full maximum likelihood estimator implementing the core model from Yang (2026), "Pricing Prediction Markets: Risk Premiums, Incomplete Markets, and a Decomposition Framework"
  - Pooled and hierarchical estimation with analytic gradients
  - Three SE estimators: Fisher, sandwich robust, Liang-Zeger clustered sandwich
  - Numerical Hessian with eigenvalue regularization and BLAS chunk-size safety
  - Model comparison (LR tests, AIC/BIC, pseudo-R²)
  - Empirical priors: Polymarket λ=0.166, Kalshi=0.187, Metaculus=0.287, Manifold=-0.218

  - Risk-adjusted scoring (PnL / |drawdown|) with 30-day exponential time decay
  - Premium-alpha strategy bonus, reserve capital, per-strategy caps
  - Graceful degradation: performance-weighted → equal → minimum budgets

  - EWMA rolling correlation estimation on price returns
  - Effective exposure via correlation matrix quadratic form
  - Concentration ratio gating, stale correlation decay

  - Uses Yang (2026) hierarchical model for per-contract λ estimation
  - Kelly-optimal sizing from model Greeks
  - Volume-tier targeting: focuses on medium-liquidity alpha sweet spot

- **Premium decay strategy** (`PremiumDecayStrategy`): timing-based premium lifecycle alpha

- **Distortion-based validation tools**: `estimate_risk_premium`, `cross_platform_premium_test`, `favorite_longshot_test` in `oracle3.market.validation`

- **79 new tests** (total: 633) covering MLE recovery, Greeks, sizing, allocation, strategies

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
