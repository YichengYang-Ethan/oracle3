Exposes public Kalshi and Polymarket market data, the venues' published fee

Oracle3 gives read access to Kalshi and Polymarket and checks whether prices of
related contracts violate the axioms of probability after venue fees.

Prices are dollars per contract, between 0 and 1. No tool places a real order;
paper_order fills against the live order book into a local paper ledger.

Typical flow: search_markets -> get_quote or get_orderbook on candidates ->
check_constraint_live with the relation you believe holds -> paper_order the
legs of the best basket.

Relations: implication (A implies B), exclusivity (at most one outcome),
complement (exactly one of two), same_event (one event on two venues),
event_sum (exactly one of n). Whether a relation actually holds is your
judgment; read both markets' resolution rules before relying on a result.

Fees follow each market's own schedule from the venue API: Kalshi taker
0.07*M*C*P*(1-P) (maker 0.0175*M*C*P*(1-P) only on series with maker fees),
Polymarket taker rate*C*p*(1-p), Polymarket makers free.
